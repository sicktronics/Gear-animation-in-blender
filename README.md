# Gear-animation-in-blender

Project log - driven/driving gear animation. This is my first end-to-end project in Blender. Following a tutorial by O.T. Vinta, I designed two involute gears that are mechanically accurate (actually, there is some pretty clever math involved in the tooth design such that the same pressure is applied between teeth regardless of the angle of interaction).

It is pretty bad, but gotta start somewhere. These gears will be used in a robot animation that I am working on, and they are pretty identical to the tried-and-true 96T 0.5" bore acetyl gears from Actobotics (absent the 0.770" mounting hole pattern).
